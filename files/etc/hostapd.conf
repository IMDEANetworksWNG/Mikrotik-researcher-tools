##### hostapd configuration file ##############################################
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored

# Interface for separate control program. If this is specified, hostapd
# will create this directory and a UNIX domain socket for listening to requests
# from external programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status information and
# configuration. The socket file will be named based on the interface name, so
# multiple hostapd processes/interfaces can be run at the same time if more
# than one interface is used.

# AP netdevice name (without 'ap' postfix, i.e., wlan0 uses wlan0ap for
# management frames with the Host AP driver); wlan0 with many nl80211 drivers
# Note: This attribute can be overridden by the values supplied with the '-i'
# command line parameter.
interface=wlan0

# Driver interface type (hostap/wired/none/nl80211/bsd);

##### IEEE 802.11 related configuration #######################################
# SSID to be used in IEEE 802.11 management frames
ssid=Mikrotik

# Country code (ISO/IEC 3166-1). Used to set regulatory domain.
# Set as needed to indicate country in which device is operating.
# This can limit available channels and transmit power.
# These two octets are used as the first two octets of the Country String
# (dot11CountryString). Can be configured as {JP, US, DE, CN}.
country_code=DE

# Operation mode (a = IEEE 802.11a (5 GHz), b = IEEE 802.11b (2.4 GHz),
# g = IEEE 802.11g (2.4 GHz), ad = IEEE 802.11ad (60 GHz); a/g options are used
# with IEEE 802.11n (HT), too, to specify band). For IEEE 802.11ac (VHT), this
# needs to be set to hw_mode=a. When using ACS (see channel parameter), a
# special value "any" can be used to indicate that any support band can be used.
# This special case is currently supported only with drivers with which
# offloaded ACS is used.
hw_mode=ad

# Channel number (IEEE 802.11)
# (default: 0, i.e., not set)
# Please note that some drivers do not use this value from hostapd and the
# channel will need to be configured separately with iwconfig.
channel=2

# Beacon interval in kus (1.024 ms) (default: 100; range 15..65535)
beacon_int=100

# Additional vendor specific elements for Beacon and Probe Response frames
# This parameter can be used to add additional vendor specific element(s) into
# the end of the Beacon and Probe Response frames. The format for these
# element(s) is a hexdump of the raw information elements (id+len+payload for
# one or more elements)
#vendor_elements=dd0411223301

# Send empty SSID in beacons and ignore probe request frames that do not
# specify full SSID, i.e., require stations to know SSID.
# default: disabled (0)
# 1 = send empty (length=0) SSID in beacon and ignore probe request for
#     broadcast SSID
# 2 = clear SSID (ASCII 0), but keep the original length (this may be required
#     with some clients that do not support empty SSID) and ignore probe
#     requests for broadcast SSID
#ignore_broadcast_ssid=0

# Client isolation can be used to prevent low-level bridging of frames between
# associated stations in the BSS. By default, this bridging is allowed.
#ap_isolate=1

##### Fast Session Transfer (FST) support #####################################
#
# The options in this section are only available when the build configuration
# option CONFIG_FST is set while compiling hostapd. They allow this interface
# to be a part of FST setup.
#
# FST is the transfer of a session from a channel to another channel, in the
# same or different frequency bands.
#
# For detals, see IEEE Std 802.11ad-2012.

# Identifier of an FST Group the interface belongs to.
#fst_group_id=bond0

# Interface priority within the FST Group.
# Announcing a higher priority for an interface means declaring it more
# preferable for FST switch.
# fst_priority is in 1..255 range with 1 being the lowest priority.
#fst_priority=100

# Default LLT value for this interface in milliseconds. The value used in case
# no value provided during session setup. Default is 50 ms.
# fst_llt is in 1..4294967 range (due to spec limitation, see 10.32.2.2
# Transitioning between states).
#fst_llt=100
